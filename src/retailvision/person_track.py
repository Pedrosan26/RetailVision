person_track.py

Turns the per-frame stream of detections into a per-person stream of events.

The pipeline detects faces frame by frame, so a single person sitting still
produces one detection per frame for as long as they are there. Logging each
one asks the same question hundreds of times and records hundreds of answers
to it, which makes a person who stayed a long time indistinguishable from a
crowd who passed through quickly, and makes any count of "people" a count of
frames instead.

Two things fix that, and both need a notion of a person rather than a
detection:

Identity is voted, not sampled. The age and gender classifiers disagree with
themselves between frames -- the same face can read 18-40 and then 41-64 --
so a track's labels are decided by majority over its first few frames and
then fixed. That is more accurate than re-asking every frame and keeping
whichever answer happened to land last, as well as far cheaper. A track is
not reported at all until it has been seen enough times to vote, which also
discards the single-frame false positives that never survive to a second
frame.

Emission is by change, not by frame. Emotion is the field that genuinely
moves, so a record is emitted when a track's smoothed emotion or its zone
changes, and otherwise on a slow heartbeat so a stationary person still reads
as present. Emotion is smoothed over a short window first: raw per-frame
predictions flicker, and emitting on every flicker would reproduce the
per-frame stream this exists to avoid.

Track IDs are random per track and per process run. They are stable enough to
group one person's records together while they are in view and nothing more --
they carry no identity, survive no restart, and are not comparable between
cameras. Deciding that one person is in two cameras at once remains the
server's spatial job (server/app/dedup.py), which is what the shared world
frame is for.
